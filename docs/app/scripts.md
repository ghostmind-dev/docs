## Automation Scripts Guide - Scripts Pattern

This guide tells an AI **exactly** what to do when implementing the **Scripts Pattern** - creating automation scripts within the standardized directory structure. This is one of the five core patterns (app, docker, infra, local, scripts) defined in our system.

**📄 Base Reference:** [base.md](https://github.com/ghostmind-dev/docs/blob/main/docs/app/base.md)

> 🧠 **IMPORTANT:** The AI must read and understand `base.md` first to learn about all five directory patterns, then return here for specific Scripts Pattern implementation details.

**📍 Pattern Focus:** This document covers the `scripts/` directory pattern only. For other patterns, refer to their respective documentation.
